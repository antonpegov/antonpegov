### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am full-stack web developer with a slope in front-end and with passion of providing people with the best user experience using cutting age technologies. Started using MEAN stack in 2014 and now have a solid experience with Angular1/2+ frameworks, Bootstrap/Google Material/KendoUI libraries, Node/Webapi back-end as well as TFS/Git+Jira workflow, Pug, Stylus, Sass, Webpack, TDD and other cool things. I live in Krakow, love this place, last few years I participate in migrating big corporate project from Angular to ReactJs, building blockchain cryptowallet for my friends using ReactJs and creating few internal tools for one well-known investment company using Angular.
